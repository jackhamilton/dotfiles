# The name of your keyboard. If you're using KMonad or another virtual
# keyboard, this should be the name of the virtual keyboard it creates.
# Otherwise, it should be your /dev/input/by-id/ input file. You may
# also omit this key if IsVirtual is false, and the program will
# attempt to autodetect it.

# If you're using KMonad or a similar program, this will cause the chatter fix
# to attempt to find a virtual keyboard with the above name instead of using
# /dev/input/by-id.

# Chatter blocking threshhold in ms. Repeated keypresses faster than this
# will be removed.
Threshhold = 30

# Verbosity for the chatter blocking part of the program. Defaults to CRITICAL,
# but you can also set to INFO and DEBUG (levels 1 and 2 respectively, with 2
# being the most verbose setting).
